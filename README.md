# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to identify how many employees will likely be retiring within the next 0-3 years. We also wanted to see out of those employees likely to retire, which job titles will have the most employees retiring so the company understands what types of roles will need to be replaced. The company had a great idea to develop a mentorship program to future proof those positions that will be vacated due to retirement. So, we needed to find all the employees who would be eligible to join this mentorship program and ultimately take over the job titles of those who are retiring. 

## Results
1. Senior Engineers is the job position with the most amount of employees about to retire (29,415). This title will likely need the most people to join the mentorship program.

2. As you can see in the previous image, the job title "Manager" only has two people who might retire so that position does necessarily need to be focused on compared to the other job titles that have much larger amounts of employees about to retire. 


3. The birth date requirements need to be expanded for the mentorship program or else there won't be enough employees to replace the retiring employees.


4. Pewlett Hackard likely needs to start hiring some younger engineers because the number of Senior Engineers and Engineers is incredibly high for the time fram selected of potential employees who will retire soon. 


### Summary

2. Are there enough Qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
  - There are definitely not enough employees who are eligible for the mentorship program. There are over 90,000 employees about to retire and only 1,549 eligible employees for mentorship. There is a considerable gap here that Pewlett Hackard needs to address immediately. As mentioned previously, focusing on the engineering positions should take top priority due to the large number of potential employees who are about to retire.
